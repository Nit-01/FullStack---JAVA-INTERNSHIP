Today’s lecture focused on advanced concepts of arrays in Java, especially two-dimensional arrays, jagged arrays, and final arrays. 
A two-dimensional array is an array of arrays and is used to store data in rows and columns format.
It is useful for representing tables and matrices. Each element is accessed using two index positions, one for row and one for column.
Memory is allocated in a structured format, and loops are used to access elements.

The mentor explained jagged arrays, which are a special type of two-dimensional array where each row can have a different number of columns. 
Unlike regular 2D arrays, memory is not equally allocated for all rows. Each row is created separately, which makes memory usage more 
flexible and efficient. Jagged arrays are useful when the data size is not the same for every row.

The concept of final arrays was also discussed. When an array is declared as final, the reference of the array cannot be changed to 
point to another array. However, the elements inside the array can still be modified. This means final prevents reassignment but 
allows updating values.

The working flow starts with declaring the array and allocating memory. For jagged arrays, each row is initialized separately. 

Elements are stored and accessed using index positions. Loops are used to traverse and print elements. These concepts are important 
for handling complex data structures in Java programs.
