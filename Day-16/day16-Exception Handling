Today’s session focused on exception handling in Java, which is used to handle abnormal conditions that occur during 
program execution. An exception is an event that interrupts the normal flow of the program. The mentor explained that 
all exceptions are part of the exception hierarchy under the Throwable class. 

There are two main types: checked exceptions, which are checked at compile time, and unchecked exceptions, which occur at runtime. Exception handling h
elps prevent program termination and allows the program to continue execution normally.

The try-catch-finally block is used to handle exceptions. 
The try block contains the code that may cause an exception. 
The catch block handles the exception and prevents the program from crashing. 
The finally block contains code that always executes whether an exception occurs or not, and it is mainly used 
for cleanup operations. The mentor also explained the use of throw and throws keywords. The throw keyword is used 
to create and explicitly throw an exception, while throws is used to declare exceptions in the method signature.

The working flow starts when the program executes code inside the try block. 
If an exception occurs, Java creates an exception object and transfers control to the catch block. The catch block 
handles the exception, and then the finally block executes. If no exception occurs, the catch block is skipped, and 
finally still executes. This mechanism ensures safe and smooth program execution.

This concept is important because exception handling improves program reliability and prevents unexpected termination.
