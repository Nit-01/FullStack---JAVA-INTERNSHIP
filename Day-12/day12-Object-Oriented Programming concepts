Today’s lecture focused on important Object-Oriented Programming concepts such as constructors, object lifecycle, 
garbage collection, and inheritance. A constructor is a special method in Java that is automatically called when an 
object is created. It has the same name as the class and does not have a return type. 

Constructors are mainly used to initialize data members of an object. Constructor overloading allows multiple constructors with different parameters so 
that objects can be initialized in different ways.

The mentor explained the lifecycle of an object. When an object is created using the new keyword, memory is allocated in 
heap memory, and the constructor is executed to initialize the object. The object remains in memory as long as it is 
being used. 

When there are no references pointing to the object, it becomes eligible for garbage collection. Garbage collection is an 
automatic process in Java that removes unused objects from heap memory and frees space.

The session also covered inheritance, which allows one class to acquire the properties and methods of another class using 
the extends keyword. The class that is inherited from is called the superclass, and the class that inherits is called the 
subclass. This helps in code reusability and reduces duplication. The subclass can use the members of the superclass and 
also add its own features.

The working flow starts when an object of the subclass is created. Memory is allocated in heap memory, and the constructor 
is executed. The subclass object can access inherited members and its own members. When the object is no longer used, 
garbage collection removes it from memory.

This concept is important because inheritance and constructors are fundamental features of object-oriented
programming in Java.
