Today’s lecture focused on understanding the String class in Java and its importance in handling text-based data. A String represents a sequence of characters and is widely used in applications such as form inputs, messages, file handling, and database operations. 

The mentor explained that Strings in Java are immutable in nature, which means once a String object is created, its value cannot be changed. If any modification is performed, a new String object is created instead of changing the existing one.

The session covered different ways of creating strings. A string can be created using string literal syntax or by using the new keyword. When created using literals, Java stores them in a special memory area called the String Constant Pool. This helps in memory optimization by reusing existing objects. When created using new, a new object is always created in heap memory.

Various built-in methods of the String class were demonstrated. Methods such as equals() are used to compare string values, charAt() is used to extract a character at a specific index, toUpperCase() and toLowerCase() are used to modify case, and split() is used to divide a string into multiple parts based on a delimiter. These methods make string manipulation simple and efficient.

The working flow begins with creating a string object. When a method is called on a string, the method processes the text and returns a new result if modification is involved. Because strings are immutable, the original value remains unchanged unless reassigned.
Understanding strings is important because text processing is a fundamental part of most Java applications.
